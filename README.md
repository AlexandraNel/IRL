## Description

**Motivation:** IRL is an MVP for a Mern Stack Application that fixes the current dating app landscape. Dating apps, as they exist today, comodify humans and turn deep lasting connections into a catalogue of synthesised accessibility. IRL attempts to link people based on real life intersts and activities that can be enjoyed, together, in the real world 

**The Why:** This project aims to assist people to transition back into the real world, engage with their communities, and connect through events with people  with similar interests. This app was built to tarin myself on the Mern stack  

**Problem Solved:** This project focusses on events which people can connect through. It takes people away from the constant chat ghosting as it takes teh ofcus off the individuals trying to sell themselves. I have used MongoDb, Express, React and Node to create this MVP as well as Boostrap for React and CSS for styling. Cloudinary was used for image encoding and retrieval  

**Lessons:** This project really gave me indepth knowledge of my Models and hwo tehy connect to eachother. I was also able to gain clarity around how GraphQl and Apollo work together. I foudn MongoCompass and the Apollo sandbox very useful
